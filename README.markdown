# Mango

Mango is a modular web-application framework for Go, inspired by [Rack](http://github.com/rack/rack) and [PEP333](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/).

## Overview

Mango is most of all a framework for other modules, and apps.  It takes a list of middleware, and an application and compiles them into a single http server object. The middleware and apps are written in a functional style, which keeps everything very self-contained.

Mango aims to make building reusable modules of HTTP functionality as easy as possible by enforcing a simple and unified API for web frameworks, web apps, middleware.

## API

As in Rack, the API is very minimal.

Applications are of the form:

    func Hello(env mango.Env) (mango.Status, mango.Headers, mango.Body) {
      return 200, mango.Headers{}, mango.Body("Hello World!")
    }

Where:

* mango.Env is a map[string]interface{} of the environment
  * It also has accessors for several other environment attributes:
    * mango.Env.Request() is the http.Request object
    * mango.Env.Session() is the map[string]interface for the session (only if using the Sessions middleware)
    * mango.Env.Logger() is the default logger for the app (or your custom logger if using the Logger middleware)
* mango.Status is an integer for the HTTP status code for the response
* mango.Headers is a map[string][]string of the response headers (similar to http.Header)
* mango.Body is a string for the response body

## Available Modules

* Sessions

  Usage: Sessions(app_secret, cookie_name, cookie_domain string)
  Basic session management. Provides a mango.Env.Session() helper which returns a map[string]interface{} representing the session.  Any data stored in here will be serialized into the response session cookie.
  
* Logger

  Usage: Logger(custom_logger \*log.Logger)
  Provides a way to set a custom log.Logger object for the app. If this middleware is not provided Mango will set up a default logger to os.Stdout for the app to log to.

* ShowErrors

  Usage: ShowErrors(templateString string)
  Catch any panics thrown from the app, and display them in an HTML template. If templateString is "", a default template is used. Not recommended to use the default template in production as it could provide information helpful to attackers.

* Routing

  Usage: Routing(routes map[string]App)
  "routes" is of the form { "/path1(.\*)": sub-stack1, "/path2(.\*)": sub-stack2 }.  It lets us route different requests to different mango sub-stacks based on regexing the path.

## Example App

    package main

    import (
      "mango"
    )

    func Hello(env mango.Env) (mango.Status, mango.Headers, mango.Body) {
      env.Logger().Println("Got a", env.Request().Method, "request for", env.Request().RawURL)
      return 200, mango.Headers{}, mango.Body("Hello World!")
    }

    func main() {
      stack := new(mango.Stack)
      stack.Address = ":3000"
      stack.Middleware(ShowErrors(""))
      stack.Run(Hello)
    }

## Mango Stacks

Mango revolves around the idea of a "stack", which is a collection of middleware and an application.  Stacks can be compiled without being run.  When you compile a stack it returns a Mango App which incorporates all of the middleware and the application.  We can compile a Mango stack like:

    stack := new(mango.Stack)
    var compiled mango.App = stack.Compile(Hello)

This compiled stack can be passed to the Routing middleware as a "sub-stack".

Stack can also be compiled into an http.HandlerFunc by calling:

    stack := new(mango.Stack)
    var listener http.HandlerFunc = stack.HandlerFunc(Hello)

This returns a http.HandlerFunc ready to be passed to http.ListenAndServe, which incorporates the entire Mango stack.

## Custom Middleware

Building middleware for Mango is fairly straightforward.

If you build some middleware and think others might find it useful, please let me know so I can include it in the core Mango source.  The success of Mango really depends on having excellent middleware packages.

An extremely basic middleware package is simply a function:

    func SilenceErrors(env mango.Env, app mango.App) (mango.Status, mango.Headers, mango.Body) {
      // Call our upstream app
      status, headers, body := app.Call(env)

      // If we got an error
      if status == 500 {
        // Silence it!
        status = 200
        headers = mango.Headers{}
        body = "Silence is golden!"
      }

      // Pass the response back to the client
      return status, headers, body
    }

To use this middleware we would do:

    func main() {
      stack := new(mango.Stack)
      stack.Address = ":3000"

      stack.Middleware(SilenceErrors) // Include our custom middleware

      stack.Run(Hello)
    }

For more complex middleware we may want to pass it configuration parameters. An example middleware package is one which will replace any image tags with funny pictures of cats:

    func Cats(cat_images []string) mango.Middleware {
      // Initial setup stuff here
      // Done on application setup

      // Initialize our regex for finding image links
      regex := regexp.MustCompile("[^\"']+(.jpg|.png|.gif)")

      // This is our middleware's request handler
      return func(env mango.Env, app mango.App) (mango.Status, mango.Headers, mango.Body) {
        // Call the upstream application
        status, headers, body := app(env)

        // Pick a random cat image
        image_url := cat_images[rand.Int()%len(cat_images)]

        // Substitute in our cat picture
        body = mango.Body(regex.ReplaceAllString(string(body), image_url))

        // Send the modified response onwards
        return status, headers, body
      }
    }

This works by building a closure (function) based on the parameters we pass, and returning it as the middleware. Through the magic of closures, the value we pass for cat_images gets built into the function returned.

To use our middleware we would do:

    func main() {

      stack := new(mango.Stack)
      stack.Address = ":3000"

      // Initialize our cats middleware with our list of cat_images
      cat_images := []string{"ceiling_cat.jpg", "itteh_bitteh_kittehs.jpg", "monorail_cat.jpg"}
      cats_middleware = Cats(cat_images)

      stack.Middleware(cats_middleware) // Include the Cats middleware in our stack

      stack.Run(Hello)
    }
